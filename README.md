# 🚀 LXC AutoScale

**LXC AutoScale** is a resource management daemon specifically designed for Proxmox environments. It automatically adjusts CPU and memory allocations with no downtime and can clone LXC containers based on real-time usage metrics and predefined thresholds. Can be run locally or remotely to make your containers always optimized for performance, managing spikes in demand, and optionally preserving resources during off-peak hours.

- **✅ Works with `Proxmox 8.2.4`**

> [!NOTE]
> If You need to autoscale Virtual Machines resources on Proxmox hosts You will like [this project](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/proxmox-vm-autoscale).

## Quick Start

Getting started with LXC AutoScale on your Proxmox host is quick and simple:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awesomekyle/proxmox-lxc-autoscale/main/install.sh | bash
```

> [!TIP]
> Once installed, the service should be up and running. You can verify this by executing:
>
> ```bash
> systemctl status lxc_autoscale.service
> ```

If the conditions set in the configuration are met, you will quickly observe scaling operations in action.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to check your `/lib/systemd/system/lxcfs.service` file for the presence of the `-l` option which makes `loadavg` retrieval working as expected. Here the required configuration:

> Delegate=yes
> ExecReload=/bin/kill -USR1 $MAINPID
>
> [Install]
> WantedBy=multi-user.target
> ```
>
> Just update the `/lib/systemd/system/lxcfs.service` file, execute `systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart lxcfs` and when you are ready to apply the fix restart the LXC containers.

## Configuration

LXC AutoScale is designed to be highly customizable. You can reconfigure the service at any time to better suit your specific needs. For detailed instructions on how to adjust the settings, please refer to the **[official documentation](https://github.com/awesomekyle/proxmox-lxc-autoscale/blob/main/docs/lxc_autoscale/README.md)**.

> [!TIP]
> If You need LXC AutoScale configuration for all your LXC containers You can automatically generate it by running this command:
> [!CAUTION]
> This doesn't seem to be necessary anymore.
> ```
> curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awesomekyle/proxmox-lxc-autoscale/main/lxc_autoscale/lxc_autoscale_autoconf.sh | bash
> ```
